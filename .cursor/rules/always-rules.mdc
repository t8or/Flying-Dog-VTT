Important: try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom.

Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out things that are important.

Do not use fallbacks in the code. Fix the symptom, don't put a bandaid over it.

Donâ€™t be helpful, be better.

Use comments in code to leave a clean trail. 

Do not delete code unless specifically asked to do so.

Use Markdown files to keep track of project progress. Break tasks down into small chunks, and keep track of completed tasks.

Do not create sub-folders without checking the entire project to see if it should go somewhere else.

Never code fallbacks or static code unless explicitly told to.
